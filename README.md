# chat-app
Native React mobile application

Description:
This chat app was developed using React Native for use on mobile devices, both Android & iOS.
The app includes a home screen to enter the chat and a chat interface via Gifted Chat to send messages, images and the user's location.

User Stories:
● As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
● As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
● As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I’m currently doing.
● As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
● As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
● As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

Key Features:
● A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.
● A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
● The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
● Data gets stored online and offline.
